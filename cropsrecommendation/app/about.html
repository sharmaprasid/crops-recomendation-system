                    <p class="  text-xl    " style="margin: 0px 300px; ">A crops recommendation system is a system that suggests suitable crops for a particular area based on user
                    inputs such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, and rainfall. The system analyzes the
                    soil and
                    environmental factors to provide personalized crop suggestions that match the user's requirements. This tool can
                    be
                    helpful for farmers, gardeners, or anyone interested in growing crops. By inputting specific data into the
                    system, users
                    can receive recommendations for crops that are most likely to grow successfully in their particular location.
                    
                    it was build as the final college project which is trained using machine learning model svm and randomforest.
                    Django is used to develop the website for crops recommendation system. For styling tailwind css is used</p>
